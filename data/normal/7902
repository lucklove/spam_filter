you are not excellent as the girl\'s dreaming
So what you should do is behave your strength.
you must give her the confidence.
you must pursuade her that you are the right one who can give her
happiness. and you will do all your effort to prove it.
just give her a beautiful future, she will agree with you.
after she agree with you, you must make her fall in love with you.
: 注册了一个马甲上来发文，是没有胆量的表现，明显不是我的风格，呵呵，见笑了。
: 不过我很想听听大家的意见，并且希望能获得帮助～
: 我喜欢过三个MM，全是我们班的，第一个追了半年，她态度坚决，于是放弃了；第二个追了一年多点吧，中间有几次想放弃了，不过又总是被她吸引，反而更加喜欢她。现在，我有了更好的机会去追她，因为工作上的原因之后的接触机会比较多，她的态度也不像一开始那么总是冷冰冰
