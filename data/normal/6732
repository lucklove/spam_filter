杭州又开始热起来了，还是喜欢有台风的日子
那天中午下雨，一个人骑车去白堤骑了一圈
看雨里面的西湖，很美
也许把自己完全寄托另外一个人身上本身就是一个错误
不要期望你给别人的幸福他就一定认为是幸福，呵呵
爱自己把
walk on   by U2
and if the darkness is to keep us apart
and if the daylight feels like it\'s a long way off
and if your glass heart should crack
before the second you turn back
oh no, be strong
walk on, walk on
what you got, they can\'t steal it
no they can\'t even feel it
walk on, walk on
stay safe tonight
you\'re packing a suitcase for a place
none of us has been
a place that has to be believed to be seen
you could have flown away
a singing bird in an open cage
who will only fly, only fly for freedom
walk on, walk on
what you got, you can\'t deny it
can\'t sell it or buy it
walk on, walk on
stay safe tonight
and i know it aches
how your heart it breaks
you can only take so much
walk on
walk on
home, hard to know what it is if you never had one
home, i can\'t say where it is but i know i\'m going
home, that\'s where the heart is
and i know it aches
how your heart it breaks
you can only take so much
walk on
all that you fashion, all that you make
all that you build, all that you break
all that you measure, all that you feel
all this you can leave behind
all that you reason, all that you care
it\'s only time and i\'ll never fill up all my mind
all that you sense, all that you scheme

:     昨天台风袭击，杭州短时间也曾风力大作，大雨如注，那是我却在出差的高速公路上。但我和他之间却是风平浪静。我不再发短信给他了，也不再打电话给他了。我们之间也许一切都要结束了。他再也不用怀着一颗忐忑不安的心了，我的短信来了，他该怎样回，他该怎样向他女朋
:     昨天手机一直攥在手中，不停的瞄一下手机的屏幕，我想掩饰我内心的不安。但我的动作也许根本就无法掩饰我内心的期盼。我也管不了那么多了。
